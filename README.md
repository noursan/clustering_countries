## K-means clustering on countries
The objective of this project is to help NGOs identify countries where humanitarian aid should be sent. To that end, principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means algorithm are used for dimensionality reduction and clustering respectively. Finally, the resulting clusters of countries are shown in a world map using geopandas and also by requesting the countries' coordinates to a public API.
